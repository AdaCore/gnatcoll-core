Known Problems in Gnatcoll 1.3
==============================

KP-13-K712-015 GNATCOLL.Projects.Register_New_Attribute has no effect

  Problem:    If this procedure is called before any project has been
              loaded, it has no effect (the newly created package is
              simply ignored by the project manager).

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.4 on 2011-08-24

  Workaround: First load a project (for instance an empty one), then
              register the new attribute, and finally load your actual
              project.

KP-13-K304-032 Configure does not detect postgreSQL on Mac OS X

  Problem:    Configure fails to detect postgreSQL on Mac OS X.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.4 on 2011-03-07

  Workaround: After running configure, manually edit gnatcoll_shared.gpr
              and change the variables Postgres_dir and Postgres.

KP-13-K303-032 Configure doesn't find gmp.h

  Problem:    If the GMP library is installed in a non-standard directory,
              configure doesn't match to properly detect it.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.4 on 2011-03-03

  Workaround: make sure that gmp.h can be found by the C compiler.

KP-13-K302-015 Gnatcoll.projects and separate units

  Problem:    The information returned by Info does not distinguish between
              bodies and separate units.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.4 on 2011-03-07

  Workaround: Most of the time, it is safe to treat separates as bodies,
              except when you need to compile them, since the compiler will
              always return an error for separates. You should be prepared
              to handle such errors in your application.
