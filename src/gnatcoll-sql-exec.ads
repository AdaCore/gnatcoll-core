------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--  This package provides subprograms to interact with a database. It provides
--  a DBMS-agnostic API, which is further specialized in children packages for
--  each supported DBMS system.
--  There are various reasons to use this package preferrably to the low-level
--  package specific to each DBMS:
--    - your code is not specialized for a specific system, and can therefore
--      more easily be moved from one system to another
--    - automatic connection and reconnection to the database.
--      If the connection is lost, this package will automatically attempt to
--      reconnect (it also automatically connects the first time a query is
--      emitted).
--    - task safe
--    - automatic transactions
--      whenever you start modifying the database, a transaction is
--      automatically started. That helps ensure that only self-consistent
--      changes are performed, and is more efficient on most DBMS. No command
--      is sent to the DBMS if the current transaction is in a failure state,
--      which is also more efficient
--    - support for local caching of some queries
--      Very often, a database will contain tables whose contents rarely
--      changes, and corresponds to Ada enumerations. In such cases, this
--      package can cache the result locally to save round-trips to the DBMS
--      system.
--    - logging support.
--      All sql queries that are executed are traced through GNATCOLL.Traces
--
--  There are various ways to execute queries and get their results:
--    - two types of cursors (forward_cursor or direct_cursor) dependeing on
--      whether you want to keep all results in memory or not. Using direct
--      cursors is more flexible, but slower since there is a need for a lot
--      more memory allocations. Examples of timing (executing 10_000 times a
--      query joining two tables, returning 400 rows).
--         sqlite:
--           FORWARD_CURSOR, getting first row     => 0.707530000 s
--           FORWARD_CURSOR, iterating on all rows => 3.193714000 s
--           DIRECT_CURSOR, getting first row      => 5.541400000 s
--           DIRECT_CURSOR, iterating on all rows  => 5.600546000 s
--
--    - Prepared statements on the client
--      Statements are generally written with GNATCOLL.SQL. They then need to
--      be converted to String to be sent to the DBMS server. This conversion
--      (along with possible auto-completion of the query) takes some non
--      negligible amount of time. You can thus prepare such queries once and
--      for all. Here is an example on the same query as above, but the query
--      is prepared once, and then executed 10_000 times. This is only looking
--      at the first row in the result, so should be compared with the first
--      line above.
--         sqlite:
--           FORWARD_CURSOR => 0.413184000 s
--           DIRECT_CURSOR  => 5.398043000 s
--
--    - Prepared statements on the server
--      In addition to the above client-side preparation, most DBMS systems
--      support the notion of analyzing the query on the server, and optimize
--      it there. Such a preparation is valid for a specific connection (so
--      several preparations will be needed if you have multiple concurrent
--      connections to the database (but this API takes care of that
--      automatically for you). This can provide significant speed up. When
--      using direct_cursor, we still need to perform a lot of memory
--      allocations to store the results in memory
--      (400 rows * 2 columns * 10_000 iterations allocations in the example)
--         sqlite:
--           FORWARD_CURSOR =>  0.047700000 s
--           DIRECT_CURSOR  =>  5.014961000 s
--
--    - Caching on the client side
--      Last, this API is able to cache the result of a query locally on the
--      client, and thus save any round-trip to the server. At the cost of some
--      memory, it provides the fastest possible access to the data. This is
--      only usable with prepared statements, and only makes sense for direct
--      cursors, since by definition the cache should be iterable several
--      times). Note also that using server-side preparation does not
--      significantly speed things up, since the statement is executed only
--      once anyway. Here, we are only doing 400 * 2 allocations to store
--      results in memory.
--         sqlite:
--             DIRECT_CURSOR =>  0.015502000 s

   --  back to a previous row (since not all DBMS backends support this).
   --  This type automatically takes care of memory management and frees its

   --  This type is tagged only so that you can override it in your own

   --  Instead of overriding Cursor directly, the support packages for the DBMS
   --  must override this type, so users do not have to use unconstrained types
   --  in their code, thus allowing "Result : Cursor" declarations.
   --  In practice, DBMS-specific backends will derive from
   --  gnatcoll-sql-exec-dbms_cursor, which defines the required primitive ops

   ----------------
   -- Parameters --
   ----------------
   --  All database systems support a way of writing queries without using
   --  specific values. Instead, those are bound when the query is executed.
   --  Thus, in sqlite, the query might look like:
   --      SELECT * FROM table WHERE table.field1 = ?1
   --  whereas in postgreSQL it would be
   --      SELECT * FROM table WHERE table.field1 = $1

   type Database_Connection is access all Database_Connection_Record'Class;
   --  A thread-specific access to a database. Each thread, in an application,

   --  are thread-specific. This also stores the result of the last query
   --  executed, and takes care of creating and cancelling transactions when
   --  needed.
   --  This type is really an access to some data, so that all subprograms
   --  below can take IN parameters. This simplifies user-code, which can
   --  therefore contain functions.
   --  This abstract type is specialized in GNATCOLL.SQL.Postgres and other
   --  child packages.
   --  Always_Use_Transactions is used internally to indicate whether GNATCOLL
   --  should always start a SQL transaction even for SELECT statements. This
   --  might result in significant speed ups for some DBMS (sqlite)

   --  The query can either be written directly as a string, or through a

   --
   --  We used procedures instead of functions here for several reasons: that
   --  allows you to extend the Cursor type without overridding these
   --  procedures, this is slightly more efficient (since Cursor is a
   --  controlled type), and that forces the user to declare a local variable,
   --  rather than use Value (Execute (...), ...), which might have
   --  unpredictable results depending on when the controlled type is
   --  finalized. This also makes it easier to have your own specialized
   --  Execute functions in your application that return specific types of
   --  cursor, without requiring possibly costly copies of the result to
   --  convert from one type to another.
   --
   --  The names differ (Fetch and Execute) depending on whether the result is
   --  read or not. This is so that you can use dotted notation, as in:
   --       Curs.Fetch (Connection, Query)
   --  which reads better than Curs.Execute (Connection, Query), since we
   --  execute the query, not the cursor.
   --
   --  Result is always first reset to No_Element, so any custom field you

   -------------------------
   -- Prepared statements --
   -------------------------
   --  Prepared statements are a way to optimize your application and its
   --  queries. There are several levels of preparation:
   --
   --    * Create parts of queries in advance, for instance a SQL_Field_List.
   --      This does not save a lot of CPU time, but saves a few system calls
   --      to malloc. This does not need any of the following subprograms.
   --
   --    * Precompute (and auto-complete) sql queries generated from
   --      GNATCOLL.SQL. That API is rather heavy, and computing
   --      auto-completion might be time consuming. This preparation is only
   --      client side and does not involve the DBMS.
   --
   --    * DBMS systems all have a way to prepare statements (on the server
   --      this time). This involves optimizing the query and how it should be
   --      executed. Such prepared statements, however, are only valid while
   --      the connection to the database lasts (or until you explicitly close
   --      the prepared statement.
   --
   --    * GNATCOLL.SQL.Exec is also able to cache (on the client) the result
   --      of some queries. This way, you avoid communication with the DBMS
   --      altogether, which provides significant speed up for often executed
   --      queries (like tables of valid values for fields, aka enumerations).
   --
   --  When combined, both of these will significantly speed up execution of
   --  queries. However, there is often little point in running exactly the
   --  same query several times. For this reason, queries can be parameterized,
   --  where the parameters can be changed before each execution. Most DBMS
   --  support this efficiently
   --
   --  Preparing statements in memory
   ----------------------------------
   --  The first time the resulting statement is executed, the internal tree
   --  structure will be converted to a string, and kept as is afterward.
   --  The tree structure is then freed.
   --  This saves memory, and is more efficient since you are saving a lot in
   --  terms of malloc and functions returning strings.
   --  The memory is automatically freed when the statement goes out of scope.
   --
   --  It is better to use such a Cached_Statement rather than simply storing
   --  the conversion to a string yourself:
   --      QS : constant String := To_String (DB, QS);
   --  The conversion to string depends on the specific database backend you
   --  are using (for instance, sqlite does not encode booleans the same way
   --  that postgreSQL does).
   --  Thus the conversion to string needs to be done only when you have an
   --  actual connection, and thus cannot be done at the library level.
   --
   --  Caching statement results
   -----------------------------
   --  If Use_Cache is True, and you are executing a SELECT query, the result
   --  of a previous execution of that query will be reused rather than
   --  executed again. If it was never executed, it will be cached for later
   --  use (no caching takes place if Use_Cache is False). This should mostly
   --  be used for queries to tables that almost never change, ie that store
   --  "enumeration types". The cache must be specifically invalidated (see
   --  Invalidate_Cache and Clear_Cache) to reset it, although it will also
   --  expire automatically and be refreshed after a while.
   --
   --  Preparing statements on the server
   --------------------------------------
   --  If On_Server is true, then a connection-specific preparation is also
   --  done on the server, for further optimization. Otherwise, the
   --  result of this call is to generate the string representation (and auto
   --  completion) of the query only once, and reuse that later on (that still
   --  provides a significant speed up). This also provides a way to cache the
   --  result of the query locally on the client.
   --  In general, On_Server should only be set if the query contains
   --  parameters (since otherwise it is too specialized to be worth keeping
   --  in memory).
   --
   --  There is little gain in having both Use_Cache and On_Server be true: the
   --  query is executed only once (until the cache expires) on the server
   --  anyway.
   --
   --  Name is used in the logs (and sometimes in the DBMS) to uniquely show
   --  the statement. If unspecified, an automatic name is computed.
   --
   --  Global prepared statements
   -------------------------------
   --
   --  The idea is that Prepared_Statement could be global variables prepared
   --  during the elaboration. Internally, they are accessed from within a
   --  protected record, so it is safe to have them as global variables even in
   --  a multi-threaded application. It is however possible to only use these
   --  as local variables, if a little inefficient since the conversion from
   --  SQL structures to a string has to be done each time. On the other hand,
   --  it saves memory since you don't need to keep the prepared statements for
   --  ever in memory.

   type Prepared_Statement is tagged private;
