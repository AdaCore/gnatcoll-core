# Update of the database when the project scenario changes:
#   - if the location of the LI file changes, and since we use the full path,
#     this will trigger another parsing.
#   - If it doesn't change, it is possible that the location of the source
#     files have changed though, but this would not be detected currently
#     because we do not parse the LI file again (this is only a problem if both
#     source files contain the same code, since otherwise the xref info has
#     changed and LI has changed). In this case, it is possible that all
#     queries will fail because we do not have info for the new location of the
#     file.
#     ??? We could search on basenames in the files table, for instance.

# An entity is known by its name and the location of its declaration. An entry
# in this table cannot exist without a corresponding declaration. To make
# queries faster (when loading ALI files), we thus store the declaration
# directly in this table, rather than as a reference. This speeds up the check
# whether an entity already exists in the table, and removes one INSERT when
# we need to create the entity.
#
# ALI files do not provide the closure of the needed entities: for instance,
# an entity A might be an instantiation of a generic entity B. But all the
# ALI file provides is the file and line where B is declared, not its column.
# In addition, B does not necessarily appear in a.ali. So we need a forward
# declaration for B (since we don't know its name, we insert a new unnamed entity
# at the given line and column -1). We'll try to complete it when b.ali is
# parsed eventually.
#
# Indexes: we tried two indexes: idx1 on name,decl_file,decl_line,decl_column,
# and idx2 on decl_file,decl_line,decl_column.
# Testing with two queries Find_Predefined_Entity (ie using name) and
# Find_Entity_From_Decl (ie only loc):

#    idx2          | idx2 (~2rows)          |  idx2 (~2rows)
#    no index      | scan (~23rows)         |  scan (~238rows)
# So having only idx2 seems a good compromise (single index is faster at creation)

# We store instantiations as a string for now: currently, they are only used to
# display tooltips in GPS as to where an entity comes from. This can easily be
# parsed from the string. But the string also makes it easy to find all
# references from the same instance as the one the user clicked on, which would
# be harder (and slower) to do if we stored the instances in a separate table,
# where each instance potentially points to its parent.
# The format is "file1|line1 file2|line2 ..." where file1|line1 is itself
# instantiated at file2|line2.
#
# This table might contain duplicates (for instance from .gli files). It is
# also possible that a given location is duplicated with different kinds, for
# instance the argument for an "in out" parameter has both a "read" and
# "modified" entries.
#
# Indexes: we have an index on "file". We used to have one on
# "file,line,column" instead. In practice, "explain query plan" shows that both
# have roughly the same performance on the DELETE query used to cleanup
# references when updating an ALI file, and on the SELECT query to find which
# entity occurs at a given location. However, the database is slightly smaller,
# and the generation of the index slightly faster, when only storing the file
# in the index.
