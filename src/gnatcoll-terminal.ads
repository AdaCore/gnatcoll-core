--  This package provides a number of cross-platform subprograms to control
--  output in terminals, in particular colors.

--  On Windows, color sequences are either set using the standard WIN32 codes,
--  or if the package ANSICON (https://github.com/adoxa/ansicon/) is running it
--  will use the standard ANSI sequences.

   type Terminal_Info_Access is access all Terminal_Info'Class;
   --  Information about a terminal on which we output.
   --  This structure does not encapsulate the terminal itself, which is a
   --  limited type.
   --  By default, this is configured without support for colors. It is thus
   --  recommended to first call Init before you use this type.
   --  This type is almost always used in conjunction with a File_Type, which
   --  is where text is actually output. The properties of that File_Type are
   --  queried and cached in the Terminal_Info.

   --  The three variants depend on which type of terminal you are outputting

   --  On Windows, it is possible for a terminal to support colors, but not
