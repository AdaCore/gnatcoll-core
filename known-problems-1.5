KP-15-MA17-007 GNATCOLL.Projects.Library_Files shows overridden files

  Problem:    This function does not always filter out ALI files that
              have been overridden in extending projects.

  Status:     Fixed in Gnatcoll 1.6.0

  Workaround: None

KP-15-MA08-038 GNATCOLL.Traces should not write to stdout by default

  Problem:    If you link with code that uses GNATCOLL.Traces (like GNATCOLL
              itself), but do not explicitly initialize GNATCOLL.Traces, then
              it is still possible that some debug output will be printed to
              stdout. This is of course undesirable, and might also lead to
              deadlock when there is no stdout available.

  Status:     Fixed in Gnatcoll 1.6.0

  Workaround: Create a config file whose single line redirects the default
              output (">/dev/null" for instance), and parse it with
              GNATCOLL.Traces.Parse_Config_File.

KP-15-MA08-010 Check_Connection fails with sqlite

  Problem:    Calling GNATCOLL.SQL.Exec.Check_Connection always returns False
              when using sqlite.

  Status:     Fixed in Gnatcoll 1.6.0

  Workaround: This function is not necessary for sqlite (the fix always
              True).

KP-15-M701-028 PyDict_Next iterator won't iterate

  Problem:    On 64 bits OS the iterator won't iterate on Python dictionary.

  Status:     Fixed in Gnatcoll 1.6.0

  Workaround: Use your own import routine with proper type for (size_t) Pos.

KP-15-M605-001 GNATCOLL.JSON parsing string ending with \\

  Problem:    GNATCOLL.JSON fails parsing a string that ends with a backslash
              as in "test\\".

  Status:     Fixed in Gnatcoll 1.6.0

  Workaround: None

KP-15-M604-002 GNATCOLL.JSON does not decode escaped slash

  Problem:    GNATCOLL.JSON does not accept a string that contains the
              sequence "\/", although it is valid JSON.

  Status:     Fixed in Gnatcoll 1.6.0

  Workaround: You can remove the \, since / itself is not a special character
              in any case.

KP-15-M320-003 GNATCOLL.Projects missing error messages

  Problem:    When a project has unresolved with statements and other errors,
              the list of error messages omits the missing with statements.
              This results in different error messages compared to gprbuild.

  Status:     Fixed in Gnatcoll 1.6.0

  Workaround: Compile with gprbuild to get the full list of error messages.

KP-15-M220-011 GNATCOLL.Projects.File_From_Unit fails on runtime files

  Problem:    This function does not handle units coming from the GNAT runtime
              and that are using special ("krunched") names, like a-textio.ads
              for instance.

  Status:     Fixed in Gnatcoll 1.6.0

  Workaround: You can explicitly test whether the file starts with "ada-",
              "system-", "interfaces-" or "gnat-" and call Krunch.Krunch.
              The solution implemented for this issue removed the parameter
              Check_Predefined_Library, which did an incorrect job anyway.

KP-15-M111-002 Compatibility with GtkAda 3.x

  Problem:    The API for Gtk_Tree_Model has changed slightly in GtkAda 3.x,
              and GNATCOLL.VFS.GtkAda.Get_File was not compatible. To ensure
              that GNATCOLL works with both GtkAda 2.x and 3.x, the first
              parameter of Get_File is now a Gtk_Tree_Model, rather than an
              access to Gtk_Tree_Model_Record, which might require an explicit
              cast in user code.

  Status:     Fixed in Gnatcoll 1.6.0

  Workaround: None.

KP-15-M107-026 Stack overflow may occur when writing large JSON objects

  Problem:    When using GNATCOLL.JSON.Write on a large JSON object, a stack
              overflow may occur.

  Status:     Fixed in Gnatcoll 1.6.0

  Workaround: None.

KP-15-LB06-010 Wrong day of week in date representation

  Problem:    GNATCOLL.Email.Utils.Format_Date will produce an invalid
              day of week name for some dates.

  Status:     Fixed in Gnatcoll 1.6.0

  Workaround: Use standard date formatting functions instead.
