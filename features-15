New features in 1.5
-------------------

NF-15-L703-035 Support for gtk3 (2012-07-04)

   A new configure switch (--with-gtk) was added to specify which version
   of gtk+ should be detected. It replaces --disable-gtk, which has been
   removed.

NF-15-L620-027 GNATCOLL.Scripts.Python cleanup of output (2012-06-20)

   When you use Execute_Command with the Hide_Output parameter set to True,
   it now only hides the result of the command (which otherwise python
   would display through sys.displayhook), and no longer the command's
   explicit output through print statements.
   Execute_Command will fail if you expect a result (string or boolean)
   when executing a command that defines a function or class.

NF-15-L619-031 Support for python 3.x (2012-06-21)

   GNATCOLL is now compatible with both Python 2 and Python 3. You can
   chose between the two by using the new --with-python-exec configure
   switch.

NF-15-L607-001 GNATCOLL.Scripts.Python support for multithreading (2012-05-10)

   Several bindings were added to control python's Global Interpreter Lock,
   thus making it possible to run several python commands in parallel.

NF-15-L406-003 GNATCOLL.Readline: new package (2012-04-06)

   This package provides an interface to the readline library, providing
   advanced interactive input.

NF-15-L328-037 gnatcoll_db2ada can now generate Create_Database (2012-04-06)

   This function (that is generated with the -adacreate switch) provides
   the necessary code to recreate the database from your application, with
   no need for the external files that define the schema and initial data of
   the database.

NF-15-L327-029 GNATCOLL.SQL.Sqlite binding for online backup API (2012-03-27)

   GNATCOLL now provides a binding to sqlite's online backup API, allowing
   to manipulate a database in memory and then dumping to the disk (or the
   opposite), which can greatly speed up operations.

NF-15-L326-008 GNATCOLL.SQL quotes table and field names (2012-03-27)

   When a table or field name is also a SQL keyword (or has a special meaning
   for one of the DBMS) it is now quoted. This gives more flexibility in what
   names can be used for the database model.

NF-15-L207-033 GNATCOLL.Traces adds support for trace hierarchies (2012-03-19)

   It is now possible to use "*." or ".*" in the configuration file to
   change the settings for multiple trace handles.

NF-15-L105-042 GNATCOLL.SQL.Postgres adds support for regexps (2012-01-05)

   The package GNATCOLL.SQL.Postgres now adds support for the postgreSQL
   specific "~*" operator, that matches regular expressions.

NF-15-KC22-014 GNATCOLL.SQL adds support for Money type (2012-03-23)

   It is now possible to use a type of "Money" for fields, which will be
   automatically converted to the appropriate DBMS type.

NF-15-KB21-014 Documentation converted to Sphinx (2011-12-07)

   The documentation was converted from texinfo to Sphinx.

NF-15-K921-016 GNATCOLL.SQL.Exec.Insert_And_Get_PK (2012-03-26)

   This new function provides an efficient way to insert a new row in a table
   and immediately retrieve its primary key (for instance when the key was
   computed from a sequence). This can be more efficient than using the
   function Last_Id.
