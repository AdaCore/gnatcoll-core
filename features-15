NF-15-K921-016 GNATCOLL.SQL.Exec.Insert_And_Get_PK (2012-03-26)

   This new function provides an efficient way to insert a new row in a table
   and immediately retrieve its primary key (for instance when the key was
   computed from a sequence). This can be more efficient than using the
   function Last_Id.
