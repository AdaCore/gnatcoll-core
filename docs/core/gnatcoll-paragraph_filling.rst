The package `GNATCOLL.Paragraph_Filling` provides several algorithms for
filling paragraphs---formatting them to take up the minimal number of lines and
to look better. `Knuth_Fill` is based on an algorithm invented by Donald
Knuth, and used in TeX. `Pretty_Fill` uses a different algorithm, which
was judged by some to produce more aesthetically pleasing output.

More detailed documentation may be found in the comments in the package spec.
