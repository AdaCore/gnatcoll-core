Introduction to the GNAT Component Collection
*********************************************

The reusable library known as the GNAT Component Collection (GNATColl)
is based on one main principle: general-purpose packages
that are part of the GNAT technology should also be available to GNAT user
application code. The compiler front end, the GNAT Programming Studio (GPS)
Interactive Development Environment, and the GNAT Tracker web-based interface
all served as sources for the components.

The GNATColl components complement the predefined Ada and GNAT libraries and
deal with a range of common programming issues
including string and text processing, memory management,
and file handling. Several of the components are
especially useful in enterprise applications.

Bug reports

Please send questions and bug reports to report@adacore.com following
the same procedures used to submit reports with the GNAT toolset itself.
