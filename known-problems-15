KP-15-M320-003 GNATCOLL.Projects missing error messages

  Problem:    When a project has unresolved with statements and other errors,
              the list of error messages omits the missing with statements.
              This results in different error messages compared to gprbuild.

  Status:     Fixed in Gnatcoll 1.6.0

  Workaround: Compile with gprbuild to get the full list of error messages.

KP-15-M220-011 GNATCOLL.Projects.File_From_Unit fails on runtime files

  Problem:    This function does not handle units coming from the GNAT runtime
              and that are using special ("krunched") names, like a-textio.ads
              for instance.

  Status:     Fixed in Gnatcoll 1.6.0

  Workaround: You can explicitly test whether the file starts with "ada-",
              "system-", "interfaces-" or "gnat-" and call Krunch.Krunch.
              The solution implemented for this issue removed the parameter
              Check_Predefined_Library, which did an incorrect job anyway.

KP-15-M111-002 Compatibility with GtkAda 3.x

  Problem:    The API for Gtk_Tree_Model has changed slightly in GtkAda 3.x,
              and GNATCOLL.VFS.GtkAda.Get_File was not compatible. To ensure
              that GNATCOLL works with both GtkAda 2.x and 3.x, the first
              parameter of Get_File is now a Gtk_Tree_Model, rather than an
              access to Gtk_Tree_Model_Record, which might require an explicit
              cast in user code.

  Status:     Fixed in Gnatcoll 1.6.0

  Workaround: None.

KP-15-M107-026 Stack overflow may occur when writing large JSON objects

  Problem:    When using GNATCOLL.JSON.Write on a large JSON object, a stack
              overflow may occur.

  Status:     Fixed in Gnatcoll 1.6.0

  Workaround: None.
