The game still goes on. The guns of the rovers are silenced;
but the tintype man, the enlarged photograph brigand, the
kodaking tourist and the scouts of the gentle brigade of
fakirs have found it out, and carry on the work. The
hucksters of Germany, France, and Sicily now bag its small
change across their counters. Gentlemen adventurers throng
the waiting-rooms of its rulers with proposals for railways
and concessions. The little opera-bouffe nations play at
government and intrigue until some day a big, silent gunboat
glides into the offing and warns them not to break their
toys.
