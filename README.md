The GNAT Components Collection (GNATcoll) - Core packages
=========================================================

This is the core module of the GNAT Components Collection. Please refer to the
documentation in the `docs/` directory.

Code status
===========

TBD

Dependencies
------------

GNATCOLL requires a recent GNAT compiler. Building it also requires
GPRbuild. GNATCOLL.Projects depends on LIBGPR library which is bundled with
the GNAT installations provided by AdaCore, and is otherwise part of
GPRbuild project.

Configuring the build process
-----------------------------

The following variables can be used to configure the build process:

General:

* `prefix`: location of the installation, the default is the running GNAT
  installation root.

* `BUILD`: control the build options: `PROD` (default) or `DEBUG`

* `PROCESSORS`: parallel compilation (default is 0, which uses all available
  cores)

* `TARGET`: for cross-compilation, auto-detected for native platforms

* `SOURCE_DIR`: for out-of-tree build

* `INTEGRATED`: if `yes` (default is `no`), consider that `prefix` is where the
  toolchain is installed and install GNATcoll in a target-dependent
  subdirectory. This makes it possible to install GNATcoll multiple times for
  the various compilers in the same prefix. Enable this only for cross
  compilers.

Module-specific:

* `GNATCOLL_MMAP`: whether MMAP is supported (yes/no) default is "yes"; has no
  effect on Windows
* `GNATCOLL_MADVISE`: whether MADVISE is supported (yes/no) default is "yes";
  has no effect on Windows

To use the default options:

```sh
$ make setup
```

For example, to setup GNATcoll to install a debug version in
`/opt/libgnatcoll`:

```sh
$ make prefix=/opt/libgnatcoll BUILD=DEBUG install
```


Building
--------

Building all versions of the GNATCOLL Core Packages (static, relocatable and
static-pic) is as easy as running `make` in the top directory. Then, to install
it:

```sh
$ make install
```

Note that underneath, this Makefile uses a GPR project file: `gnatcoll.gpr`.
You can build GNATCOLL using it with GPRbuild, but make sure to use the same
command-line options.


Bug reports
-----------

Please send questions and bug reports to report@adacore.com following
the same procedures used to submit reports with the GNAT toolset itself.
