New features in 1.8
-------------------

NF-18-O710-022 UNIQUE keyword in database schema description (2015-07-10)

  The unique constraints and indexes could be defined in the SQL database
  schema description file.

NF-18-O513-035 GNATCOLL.Memory: enhance memory debug capability (2015-06-01)

  GNATCOLL.Memory package uses GNAT.Debug_Pools package to add the following
  debug capabilities:
  - double free detection
  - reset content on free (fill with DEADBEEF pattern)
  - delay memory free to detect invalid memory accesses
  - report errors through stdout outputs or exceptions
  Requires GNAT.Debug_Pools from 2015 May 27 or later

NF-18-O422-013 GNATCOLL.Refcount: new package Shared_Pointers (2015-05-18)

  A new implementation for reference counted types is provided. It provides
  a more flexible API than the Smart_Pointers (since the Element_Type does
  not need to be a tagged type derived from Refcounted), and is faster,
  thanks to the use of storage pools. The API is safer since Get now returns
  a reference type rather than a direct access to the element.
  This new package is used throughout GNATCOLL, in particular GNATCOLL.SQL.
  In general, this has no effect on existing code.
