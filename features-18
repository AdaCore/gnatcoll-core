NF-18-O422-013 GNATCOLL.Refcount: new package Shared_Pointers (2015-05-18)

  A new implementation for reference counted types is provided. It provides
  a more flexible API than the Smart_Pointers (since the Element_Type does
  not need to be a tagged type derived from Refcounted), and is faster,
  thanks to the use of storage pools. The API is safer since Get now returns
  a reference type rather than a direct access to the element.
  This new package is used throughout GNATCOLL, in particular GNATCOLL.SQL.
  In general, this has no effect on existing code.
