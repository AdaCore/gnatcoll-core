KP-16-MB29-017 GNATCOLL.JSON crashes decoding high Unicode codepoints

  Problem:    GNATCOLL.JSON.Read raises Constraint_Error when processing
              a string literal containing an encoded reference to a Unicode
              codepoint beyond U+7FFF (e.g. "\uA726").

  Status:     Fixed in Gnatcoll 1.7.0

  Workaround: None

KP-16-MB28-001 Stack usage issues with the JSON stream decoder

  Problem:    The stack usage of the JSON serializer/deserializer is too high
              when working on very large JSON string values, and JSON object's
              key values.

  Status:     Fixed in Gnatcoll 1.7.0

  Workaround: None

KP-16-MB19-040 gnatcoll_db2ada: fix handling of 'numeric(x,y)'

  Problem:    When a database schema contains a 'numeric(x,y)' type, that
              type needs to be mapped either to an integer or to a float on
              the Ada side. So far, gnatcoll_db2ada was always mapping to
              integers.

  Status:     Fixed in Gnatcoll 1.7.0 on 2013-11-20

  Workaround: Export the schema to a txt file, and replace the types
              manually in that file. It is in any case better than extracting
              the schema from a live database, because you can put it under
              revision control.
