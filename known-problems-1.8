KP-18-P503-055 gnatinspect: body of package does not depend on spec

  Problem:    When GNATCOLL.Xref or gnatinspect are used to generate a
              cross-reference database from the ALI files created by
              the compiler, they do not store the fact that the body
              of a package implicitly always depends on its spec. The
              result is the dependency browser in GPS, for instance,
              also does not display this information.

  Status:     Fixed in Gnatcoll 17.0 on 2016-05-26

  Workaround: You can put an explicit with in the body of the
              package.

KP-18-P401-004 GNATCOLL.JSON and tasks

  Problem:    The reference counters used by this package are not task
              safe, and thus could become corrupted when the same JSON
              data is passed from one task to another.

  Status:     Fixed in Gnatcoll 17.0 on 2016-04-04

  Workaround: Wrap the JSON data with protected types, although this will
              be slower.

KP-18-P120-046 Link against Gnatcoll_Python fails on Windows

  Problem:    It is not possible to link with the Gnatlcoll_Python shared
              library on Windows. Some missing symbols are reported.

  Status:     Fixed in Gnatcoll 17.0 on 2016-02-03

  Workaround: Use the static version of this library.

KP-18-P115-021 Email.Get_Recipients crash on invalid headers

  Problem:    Get_Recipients will raise an exception for messages
              containing recipient with invalid UTF-8 encodings.

  Status:     Fixed in Gnatcoll 17.0 on 2016-01-15

  Workaround: Do not process such invalid messages.

KP-18-P111-053 Leak when loading a project with subunits.

  Problem:    Used more and more memory each time when recompute a project.

  Status:     Fixed in Gnatcoll 17.0 on 2016-19-01

  Workaround: No workaround.

KP-18-OC08-003 SQL_Table_List and SQL_Left_Join_Table not task safe.

  Problem:    Concurrent copy from constant of that types brokes internal
              reference counter which could cause unexpected Constraint_Error
              further.

  Status:     Fixed in Gnatcoll 17.0 on 2015-12-08

  Workaround: Use protected operations for such copies.

KP-18-OB30-013 gnatinspect crashes on parsing project tree

  Problem:    Gnatinspect crashes with a constraint error on a rare and rather
              complex project structure.

  Status:     Fixed in Gnatcoll 17.0 on 2015-12-15

  Workaround: No workaround.

KP-18-OB02-038 Projects: default branch in case statement breaks saving

  Problem:    When a case statement in the project file has a default branch
              and not all of possible choices mentioned the remaining
              choices appear after the "when others" branch thus making
              the project illegal.

  Status:     Fixed in Gnatcoll 17.0 on 2015-11-06

  Workaround: Specify all choices in case statements.

KP-18-OA16-022 GNATCOLL.Config fails when first line is empty

  Problem:    When GNATCOLL.Config is used to parse a file whose first line
              is empty, it results in a constraint error.

  Status:     Fixed in Gnatcoll 17.0 on 2015-10-30

  Workaround: Remove the empty line in the config file
