New features in 1.4
-------------------

NF-14-K729-026 New package GNATCOLL.Pools (2011-07-29)

   This package provides an implementation for a task-safe resource pool,
   where resources are allocated when needed, automatically released to the
   pool when no longer needed, and then reused later on.

NF-14-K322-002 GNATCOLL.Scripts.Python: better support for boolean (2011-03-22)

   The function Nth_Arg uses the standard python way to check whether a
   parameter is True or False (for instance, an empty list will now be
   considered as False when returned as a boolean). For backward compatibility,
   the strings "false" and "0" are still mapped to False, although this is
   different from what python itself would do.

NF-14-K318-018 GNATCOLL.Scripts.Execute_Command returns any object (2011-03-21)

   A new function Execute_Command that directly modifies the Callback_Data
   is now provided. Through it, you can call a python function that returns
   an integer, string, boolean or a list of them, and retrieve that value
   from Ada.

NF-14-K304-012 GNATCOLL.SQL supports auto-increment fields (2011-03-03)

   When creating a database through GNATCOLL, it is now possible to
   specify that a field should be automatically incremented.

NF-14-K304-004 GNATCOLL.SQL creates database with indexes (2011-03-03)

   When creating a database through GNATCOLL (and when the schema is
   specified in a text file), it is now possible to specify indexes to
   create, to speed up queries.

NF-14-K302-018 GNATCOLL.Traces can now specify colors (2011-03-24)

   It is now possible to specify the color to use when logging test via
   the Trace procedures.

NF-14-K111-003 Support for Unicode strings in the python interface (2011-01-11)

   Passing unicode strings to Ada is now possible and returns an UTF8 encoded
   string.

NF-14-JA21-009 New package GNATCOLL.Config (2010-12-22)

   This package provides handling of configuration files, in particular
   Windows' INI files

NF-14-I606-001 GNATCOLL.SQL now supports prepared statements (2011-01-21)

   Prepared statements are precompiled statements on the DBMS server. They
   execute much faster than statements represented as strings.
   GNATCOLL now also supports parameterized queries, ie the actual values
   used in SQL_Criteria can be provided only when the query is executed.
   This makes it possible to prepare a general query, and then reuse it
   with various parameters, providing much greater speeds.
