New features in 1.7
-------------------

NF-17-N902-040 GNATCOLL.Email: Reset multipart to single part (2014-09-02)

  Procedure Convert_To_Single_Part now takes an additional formal
  parameter Purge (default False). When Purge is set True, the message
  is reset to an empty single part text/plain payload, regardless of
  previous contents.

NF-17-N819-020 GNATCOLL.SQL: support for bigint (2014-08-29)

  Add support for the standard sqlite type BIGINT, mapping to a
  Long_Long_Integer.

NF-17-N730-023 GNATCOLL.Atomic: new package (2014-08-11)

  This package provides some task-safe, low-level subprograms, which are
  implemented via CPU-supported atomic operations when possible.

NF-17-N623-003 configure: search for sqlite in path/lib64 (2014-06-23)

  When a path is passed to configure's --with-sqlite switch, we now test both
  the lib and lib64 directories.

NF-17-N527-002 Linking with static libpq (postgres) (2014-05-27)

  It is now possible to link with a static version of the postgres library,
  by passing its full path to configure's --with-postgres switch.

NF-17-N409-022 GNATCOLL.Xref.Get_Entity searching in all files (2014-04-10)

  It is now possible to call Get_Entity and look for that entity in all
  sources of the project, rather than in a specific file.

NF-17-N401-014 Creating new nested modules in gnatcoll.scripts (2014-04-01)

  It is now possible to programmatically create nested modules, or even new
  toplevel modules from the GNATCOLL.Scripts API. For instance, you could
  now export a class to 'MyApp.MyModule.MyClass', and another to
  'MyApp_Internal.MyClass'. The latter is in particular useful when you want
  to export low-level functions from Ada, and wrap them in a higher-level
  API directly in python.

NF-17-N318-055 Update to sqlite 3.8.4.1 (2014-03-20)

  Mostly performance improvements

NF-17-N224-034 New function Create_Config_Pragmas_File (2014-02-26)

  A new function Create_Config_Pragmas_File is added to package
  GNATCOLL.Projects.Aux. It creates a temporary file that contains the
  configuration pragmas for a project tree and returns the full path of
  the temporary file.

NF-17-N203-036 GNATCOLL.Terminal new package (2014-02-03)

  This package provides advanced console output features, like color
  output and displaying progress indicator. It works on both Unix and Windows
  systems.

NF-17-N108-018 GNATCOLL.SQL: support for CREATE TABLE AS (2014-01-08)

  The CREATE TABLE AS SQL query is now supported. In particular it can
  be used to create temporary tables to hold the results of an intermediate
  query.

NF-17-MC19-005 GNATCOLL.Xref support for aggregate projects (2014-02-18)

  GNATCOLL.Xref and gnatinspect now support aggregate projects. To port
  your application, you mostly need to replace calls to Info with calls
  to Info_Set, since a given file can now belong to several projects. This
  returns the list of possible project, and you can either use some other
  context to choose the appropriate project, or take the first one (which
  will not work for all types of aggregates though).

NF-17-MB29-039 GNATCOLL.SQL.Exec.Float_Value new param Default (2013-12-01)

  A new version of Float_Value has been added. It takes a default value, and
  can be used even if the corresponding column is empty or does not contain
  a float.

NF-17-MA27-009 GNATCOLL.Xref.Methods, new param Include_Inherited (2013-11-05)

  It is now possible to only query non-inherited methods.

NF-17-MA25-038 GNATCOLL.SQL.ORM: supports for views (2013-11-04)

  It is now possible to generate a high-level database interface for
  views, in addition to tables.

NF-17-MA10-035 GNATCOLL.Mmap: multiple region mapping (2013-10-24)

  Multiple regions of the same file can now be mapped in memory at the
  same time.

NF-17-M703-040 GNATCOLL.Projects support for aggregate projects (2013-12-17)

  It is now possible to load aggregate projects through this API.
